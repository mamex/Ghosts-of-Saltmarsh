[[FiftyFifty]] find [[Tom]] and [[Will]] at the [[Grand Temple]] - [[Will]] is looking a lot better. Both can join the combat if necessary.
The party heads through the forest path taken last time - longer but stealthier.
There are now guards from [[Sanbaletâ€™s Gang]] moving through the ground floor of the house.
As the party moves around the edge of the house, [[Jit (Ayre)]] sees one of the guards stop for a moment. [[Aldion (Jagged)]] notices the guards not changing their locations. The party has likely been spotted.
Combat begins.
Arancar's corpse appears to have been chained to the wall - mutilated. He's been hung up in the form of a spider. His arms and legs have been removed. His ribs have been torn open to create the legs of the spider. The wall says "Drow poison".
[[Undead Minotaur]] and [[Skeletons]] in the basement.
The [[Undead Minotaur]] appears to have been made of 2 fused [[Minotaur]] skeletons.
When the skeletons die, a blue light appears from the wall.
Stepping out from the portal, a spectral figure in a robe and pointed hat appears.
All of the skeletal forms are rattling on the floor.
There are outlines in the room where the [[Skeletons]] and [[Undead Minotaur]] were once sat.
"Secrets found and lost then found again. Your paltry minds cannot fathom." said by the spectral figure.
Above the forms hand is the letter C.
The skeletal forms have been reinforced, either made or summoned with intention. Augmented after creation.
The [[Skeletons]] have been coated in gold leaf.
The [[Undead Minotaur]] has had parts cast in gold. The skull is gold. The ribs are tipped in gold.
The spectral figure had a bag of many pouches.
There is a strong smell in the air, reminiscent of the smell of the acid poison first encountered when entering the basement.
When asked if the C represents the [[Colland Kingdom]]: "I have no interest in what was lost."
When asked what the [[Philosopher's Stone]], the figure looks towards where it came from.
As [[Duartle (Pabo)]] approaches, the figure raises its hand to its chest.
The blue light portal is a hidden door that leads to a room filled with broken alchemical materials and equipment.
As [[Saint Moon (Tange)]] approaches the desk that has a book of some kind on it, the door closes, locking her alone in the room alone.
A dazzling display of colours fills the room. Fireworks fill the room, and the door unlocks. The skeletal forms rise from the ground.
The spectral form begins laughing.
The room has a solid gold human skull and rose. Books, scales, and a red stone with faces on.
The skeletal forms seem...chill.
There is a hidden door found by one of the [[Skeletons]], seeming to lead down 10-15ft. There is a much newer, locked door at the bottom.
When asked if it wants the intruders removed from the house, the figure takes a singular copper from [[Golath]]. There is the aura of a smile. The copper is turned into a key.
The key does not open the room in the larger sleeping area.
The room appears to be someone's bedroom.
	There is a book about tides (Naval Almanac), one about treaties with minions of Thay, a volume of romantic literature.
	Floor-length oilskin coat with lots of pockets hangs in the wardrobe.
	Under the table is a small compartment. There is book with a $ on the cover. The inside is unintelligable.
		Dancing lights
		Comprehend languages
		Tenser's floating disk
		Shatter
		Colour Spray
	12 candles, flint and steel. "Signalling system" on a piece of paper. The paper contains the phrases for communicating with the ship. Requires a bullseye lantern.
The figure eats the silver piece handed to him by [[Saint Moon (Tange)]].
The [[Skeletons]] and [[Undead Minotaur]] go back to their resting places.

	5 bolts of silk.
	8 Casks of brandy (10g ea).

One of the [[Hobgoblins]] has interesting, unordinary splint mail (Mariner's enchantment).
[[Jit (Ayre)]]'s guiding bolt...passes through [[Sanbalet]].
[[Golath]] tries to use the [[Dread Pipes]]...it fails, but something stirs...the [[Undead Minotaur]] charges through the tunnel, enraged.
Flicking a copper at the [[Undead Minotaur]] seems to bring it over [[FiftyFifty]]'s side.
[[Golath]] summons [[Clay Elephant]].
The [[Undead Minotaur]] destroys the tunnel as it heads back to its resting place.
[[Sanbalet]] is downed - the party is immensely roughed up.
The book contains [[Sanbalet]]'s story.
Originally went around looking for components for alchemy. He was an adventurer.
Arrived in [[Town of Saltmarsh]] to look at the [[Haunted Mansion]] having heard stories of it formerly belonging to an alchemist.
He joined a pirate gang as smuggling was so lucrative.
Hired [[Hobgoblins]] as he felt people were trying to muscle him out of the gang.
The rowboat for 100g.
[[Sanbalet]] considers himself an introvert.
