[[Weekly Market]] day.
Flamerule 13.
[[Saint Moon (Tange)]] tells party about [[Allura]] and events from [[Notes from 231021]] with [[Beggar Tom]].

Party is pointed towards the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]] to start looking for [[Allura]].
[[Sharkfin Bridge]] still affects the Fae-blooded.
[[Weekly Market]] is incredibly busy.

Fight happened at the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]]. Guy ([[Robert Farlight]]) that runs the operation made to come to [[Weekly Market]] instead of someone else. Argument over events - someone else wanted to use the space at the market. He doesn't like the pirates and smugglers that occupy the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]] [[Sanbalet’s Gang]]. They've not been there that long. Clearly held his own - battered hands.
