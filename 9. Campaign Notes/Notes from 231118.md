[[The Council]] Meeting starts the session.
[[Anders Salmor]] has finally arrived back in town.
[[Saint Moon (Tange)]] hopes that [[Allura]] is being held captive and not the actual [[Night Hag]].
The 6 [[Soul Larva]] are put into a clay jar.
Party hears a rumour that the [[Quartermasters of Thay]] occasionally sell items on the market.
[[Grish (Chett)]] gives his Greataxe to [[Mafera]] to have it silvered - 3 day order (ready on Flamerule 16).
The [[The Council]] Meeting is private.
[[Will]] and [[Tom]] defend [[FiftyFifty]] during their testimony about the [[The Standing Stones]].
[[Anders Salmor]] is bothered by [[Sanbalet’s Gang]] still being in town for some reason.
[[Eda Oweland]] and [[Eliander Fireborn]] are bothered by the [[Night Hag]].
[[Skaren]] has no reaction to anything being said.
[[Eda Oweland]] disgusted by more recruiting for [[Sanbalet’s Gang]] happening.
[[Codex/8. Rumours/Mere of Deadmen|Mere of Deadmen]] has a history with Hags.
A lot of the outsiders that come to town disappear without a trace - no one's really paid much attention to it.
[[Will]] and [[Anders Salmor]] seem to have had nightmares due to [[Allura]], but perhaps it's just trauma.
[[Eliander Fireborn]] may have been affected too.
[[Allura]]'s house's architecture doesn't match the rest of town - the wood is wrong, much more southern and...swampier. The house is very old. Scratch marks on doors - mostly around the handles.
In the kitchen are human bones - hidden in drawers, skulls in a kettle. A casserole of rotten human flesh, and a soul larva.
[[Allura]]'s closet has gone from generic clothing to mismatching shoes and clothes and armour.
The paintings on the wall are now seen to be bloody handprints on canvas.
The bed [[Saint Moon (Tange)]] slept on is a [[Mimic]].
Under the bed are bones that [[Scrappy]] the [[Mimic]] had been playing with.
On a table, stabbed through multiple time, a note saying "Please feed [[Scrappy]] on your way out."
The attic has black candles with orange candles, the room is full of cobwebs. The candles lit upon [[Saint Moon (Tange)]] entering the attic.
[[Saint Moon (Tange)]] loses control and hits the candles - they snuff out. She felt some kind of impact...
The attic looks more like a cave than an actual attic.
The cobwebs are patterned, sized and spaced...perhaps regularly. They are a map of the [[Sword Coast]] - larger marks are settlements, there are other marks that couldn't be understood.
The only footprints in the whole house are [[Saint Moon (Tange)]]'s...
The candles were part of some old, old ritual.
The house collapses, where it stood is grass and gravel.
All of [[Saint Moon (Tange)]]'s rations are old, mouldy.

---
Flamerule 14.
[[FiftyFifty]] plans for the raid on [[Sanbalet’s Gang]].
[[Will]] and [[Tom]] are asked to ready [[The Marines]].
[[Will]] seems to have Blood Fever since last night - he has some kind of necromantic affect on him.
[[Allura]] poisoned the food at [[Thomas the Baker]]'s shop.
[[Carpenters’ Guildhall]] made an order.
[[Eda Oweland]] gets [[Sergeant Ben]] to organise the militia to get people that have symptoms sent to the [[Grand Temple]].
The party receives a response letter for delivering [[Eula Lawrence]]'s corpse. [[Big Bang]] sent a [[Staff of the Adder]] as thanks for the corpse and [[Frostbrand Sword]].
The town is in panic mode, but is thankful to [[FiftyFifty]] for letting them know.
[[Saint Moon (Tange)]] heads to [[Willow]]'s house. [[Womp]] ([[Willow]]'s sister) says [[Willow]] was crying - apparently she was fired.
The tea that [[Willow]] has on her shelf as rewards for doing well are...very good tea!
[[Allura]] wanted [[The Commons]] to be split into 2 parts - [[The Council]] denied it. She wanted outsiders to feel more comfortable in the area around her part of town, with fewer guards.
[[Allura]] left town for 6 years 9 years ago after her proposal was struck down.
Elves used to live on this side of town before then.
[[Willow]] wants to grow plants and flowers along the river's edge by [[Hoolwatch]].
[[Willow]] was getting herbs for [[Allura]] to make poisons.
[[Willow]] bought tea for/from [[Keledek]] from [[Calimshan]].
[[FiftyFifty]] visits [[Keledek]].
[[Aldion (Jagged)]] offers the [[Soul Larva]] in exchange for having the curses placed by [[Allura]] removed.
The [[Soul Larva]] could be used to find [[Allura]] or her [[Coven]].
5 [[Soul Larva]] exchanged for curse removal. [[Keledek]] uses a 6th level spell.
[[Will]], [[Anders Salmor]], and [[Eliander Fireborn]] confirmed to have been cursed - they would have died by the end of the week.
[[Aldion (Jagged)]] received a small book on Candle Magic - 9 chapters - 1 day of reading.
