Party name????
	[[FiftyFifty]]
The party receives the [[Jewelled Loupe]].
[[Balin Ironbeard]] joins the party to raid the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]].
	Has fought with [[Duartle (Pabo)]] against blackfooted goblins.
[[FiftyFifty]] heads to the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]].
There are flagger lookouts in front of the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]].
[[Sanbalet’s Gang]] occupy the 2 docks outside the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]], not the warehouses themselves.
The [[Sea Star]] is the bosun running the docks for [[Sanbalet’s Gang]] at the [[Fishmonger’s Plant]].
[[The Iron Thorn]].
[[Sanbalet’s Gang]] sold [[Kidnapped Dwarfs]] to a cult. Around a dozen.
[[Declan]] offers to read [[Sanbalet’s Gang]] lantern in exchange for being allowed to change line of work - alive.
[[FiftyFifty]] receives a trapped box and a piece of jade worth 110g.
47 silver.
Note on [[The Iron Thorn]]'s body.
	Jade - ritual components - illusion magic - gem dragons - foreign craftsmen. Seems to be gibberish, notes taken by [[The Iron Thorn]]?
[[Allura]]'s wounds keep changing appearance, and she was able to kick the heavy crate with ease.
[[Golath]] gets a strong BIG fiend feeling using Divine Sense with [[Allura]] near.
Small fiends in the water? Soul lava?
As the pelt is removed from the inside of the box. The process is similar to ripping skin off a creature, the box is bleeding as though it is alive. The pelt is familiar...the box is made of [[Ned Poacherman]]. As the skinning of the box comes to a finish, [[Allura]] planeshifts away, a smell of sulphur lingers on the air.
Likely [[Allura]] is a Night Hag.
Too many lesser fiends on the trip into [[Town of Saltmarsh]] should have flagged a larger fiend in the area.
People suffered an odd number of nightmares in the area of the [[Codex/5. Locations Around Saltmarsh/Mere of Deadmen|Mere of Deadmen]].
Potion of Resist Poison is actually is a poison - vulnerability poison.
The poison is a blood-based poison.
[[Sea Star]] knew about the Nedbox.
The Nedbox was brought to the docks by orphan kids. [[Sea Star]] didn't recognise them, they're not from [[Town of Saltmarsh]].
The pole [[Allura]] was tied to is bleeding. The post was [[Martha]] - polymorphed.
6 [[Soul Larva]] are collected.
The 3 pirates and [[Martha]] are taken to the temple for any help the priests might be able to provide.
The Nedbox is also taken for internment...
[[Declan]], [[Kieren]], and [[Quienten]] stay at the [[Grand Temple]] for recovery, [[Declan]] wants to stay to help out after his recover.
[[Krag the Gravekeeper]] - half-orc. [[Gristle Pete (Pyrugh)]]'s brother. Stays at [[Eliander Fireborn's House]].
