# Story of a Friendly Siren
Kind young siren came to backwater fishing town that couldn’t build boats.

Told villagers of a [[Marid]] that could grant wishes, hoping to help them with their fishing.

Villagers captured and sacrificed her, banishing her body, tethering her soul to the stones.

The magic is so foul, fae are sickened by it.

When her family learnt of this, they went looking for her.

[[Town of Saltmarsh]] eventually prospered without her aid anyway.
